# CS410 - Intro to Web Development Final Project #
This is a personal website that aims to highlight myself and my professional experience within the field of computer science so far. This was created as a final project for my CS410 course at Portland State University, Intro to Web Development. The requirements for this project include implementation of a navigation bar, about section, previous work section, projects section, and a contact section. As stated in the project requirements, it was not necessary to implement functionality for the contact form submission.

## Running the Code ##
This was created in VScode and utilizing the Live Server extension. To run the code, either clone the repo or download ZIP file. After this, using the Live Server extension, you can open index.html using Live Server. Alternatively, you can go directly to the live site which was deployed using GitHub Pages: https://natashanaylor.github.io/
